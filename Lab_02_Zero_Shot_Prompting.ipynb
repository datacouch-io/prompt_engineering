        "Welcome to Lab 2! Zero-Shot Prompting. In this lab, we will explore the concept of zero-shot prompting, a technique where you provide a prompt without any examples, and the AI generates a response based solely on the information in the prompt. This lab will help you understand how to craft effective prompts and recognize the limitations and capabilities of AI models in a zero-shot context.\n",

        "**Why This Matters:**\n",
        "Zero-shot prompting is a powerful tool in AI, especially when you need the model to perform tasks without prior examples. However, it requires a deep understanding of how to structure prompts effectively to get the desired outcome. By mastering this technique, you’ll be better equipped to leverage AI in various real-world scenarios.\n",
