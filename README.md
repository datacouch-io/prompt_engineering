-   **Lab 17: Conversational Agents**


## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.7 or later
-   OpenAI API key
-   Basic understanding of Python programming
-   Familiarity with machine learning concepts (helpful but not required)

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```
    https://github.com/datacouch-io/prompt_engineering.git
    cd prompt_engineering` 
    ```
2.  **Install Required Packages:**
    
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ``` 
    
3.  **Set Up Your OpenAI API Key:**
    
    Ensure you have an OpenAI API key. You can set it up as an environment variable:
    
    ```
    export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can directly set it within your Python scripts.
    
4.  **Run a Lab:**
    
    Each lab is contained in a Jupyter notebook. You can start Jupyter and open any lab:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    
    Then, navigate to the lab you want to run and follow the instructions within the notebook.
    

## Usage

-   Each lab is designed to be run independently.
-   Follow the instructions provided in the notebooks to complete the exercises.
-   You can modify the code and prompts to experiment with different approaches and see how they affect the output.
