        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "In today's world, conversational agents, often known as chatbots, have become a crucial component of many digital interactions. From customer service to personal assistants, these AI-driven tools are designed to simulate human conversation and provide valuable assistance across various platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, we will explore the fundamentals of building conversational agents using Azure OpenAI. Our focus will be on two main aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Building a Basic Chatbot:** We will start by creating a simple chatbot that can engage in basic conversations. This chatbot will respond to user inputs based on predefined prompts. By doing so, you will learn how to craft effective prompts to guide the chatbot's responses and ensure they are relevant and coherent.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Handling Multi-Turn Conversations and Context Management:** Next, we will enhance our chatbot to manage multi-turn conversations. Unlike single-turn interactions, multi-turn conversations require maintaining context across multiple exchanges. This capability is crucial for creating a more engaging and natural conversational experience. You will learn how to manage conversation history and context to ensure that the chatbot can handle ongoing dialogues effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this lab, we will leverage Azure OpenAI's powerful language models to process and generate responses. Azure OpenAI provides advanced AI capabilities that enable chatbots to understand and generate human-like text, making interactions more intuitive and useful.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this lab, you will have hands-on experience in:\n",
        "- Creating a basic chatbot that can respond to user queries.\n",
        "- Extending the chatbot to handle complex conversations that require context management.\n",
        "- Utilizing Azure OpenAI's API to power conversational agents effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether you're looking to integrate chatbots into customer service platforms, develop personal assistants, or simply explore the potential of conversational AI, this lab will provide you with the foundational skills and knowledge to get started.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's dive into the code and start building our conversational agents!\n"
