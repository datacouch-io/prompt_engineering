    "# COSTAR Methodology Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "The COSTAR methodology is a structured approach to prompt engineering that helps guide large language models (LLMs) to produce accurate, relevant, and well-structured outputs. COSTAR stands for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response. Each of these components plays a critical role in shaping the prompt to achieve the desired outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore the COSTAR methodology in detail, implement examples with code, and see how this approach can be used effectively in prompt engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction to COSTAR Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is COSTAR?**\n",
    "\n",
    "COSTAR is a framework designed to help prompt engineers create structured and effective prompts for LLMs. By providing clear guidelines for each component of the prompt, COSTAR ensures that the modelâ€™s output aligns with the userâ€™s intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use COSTAR?**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Clarity:**  COSTAR helps break down complex tasks into manageable components.\n",
    "-   **Precision:**  By specifying the objective, style, tone, audience, and response format, you can guide the model to produce highly relevant outputs.\n",
    "-   **Flexibility:**  COSTAR can be applied to various tasks, from content creation to technical problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Breakdown of COSTAR Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context ( C ):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing background information that helps the LLM understand the specific scenario, ensuring relevance in its responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "context = \"You are a customer service representative for a software company.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective (O):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly defining the task directs the LLMâ€™s focus to meet that specific goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "objective = \"Your task is to respond to a customer inquiry about a software bug.\"\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "**Style (S):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying the desired writing style, such as formal, informal, or technical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "style = \"Write in a professional and empathetic tone.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tone (T):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting the tone ensures the response resonates with the required sentiment, whether it be formal, humorous, or empathetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "tone = \"Maintain a calm and reassuring tone.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audience (A):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the intended audience tailors the LLMâ€™s response to be appropriate and understandable for specific groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "audience = \"The audience is a non-technical customer who may be frustrated with the issue.\"\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "**Response (R):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing the response format, like a list or JSON, ensures the LLM outputs in the required structure for downstream tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "response_format = \"Respond in a short paragraph.\"\n",
    "```"
