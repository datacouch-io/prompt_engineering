        "The Flipped Interaction Pattern is an advanced technique in human-computer interaction where the AI model takes a more active role in guiding the conversation. Instead of the user primarily asking questions, the model initiates questions to gather the necessary information. This approach is particularly useful in complex decision-making scenarios, where understanding user preferences and needs is crucial.\n",

However, this can sometimes lead to incomplete or ambiguous interactions, especially when the user is unsure of what they need.
